1. This person has an average energy of 0.65906, an average danceability of 0.71646 and an average valence of 0.484443. The energy of this person's playlist
does not indicate a particular mood as 0.65 is around in the upper middle of the max energy value (0.91) and the lowest energy value (0.296). Person's pretty aight.

2. This method does not consider the meaning of the lyrics of each song but only the phonetics-related metrics. A song could be very slow, which would indicate
the person's calmed and easy, but have very violent, dark or negative lyrics which would contradict an easy and calmed behavior and suggest an aggresive or
depressive one. This is one example of how this system could be flawed.
