-- 1) Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away.

-- I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.

-- 3) As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call,
-- I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
-- The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
