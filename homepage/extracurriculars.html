                        During my sophomore year, I was reading a book about cryptocurrencies and stumbled upon the Secure Hashing Algorithm 256-bit (SHA-256).
                        I enjoyed reading about this algorithm so much that I ended up writing a 28-page research paper about it and publishing it in the educational
                        Mexican journal Visión Educativa IUNAES. My paper did not have a scientific/discovery-oriented goal but a pedagogical one: I realized
                        there was very little literature about SHA-256 that a cryptography enthusiast without the expertise of an undegraduate or graduate
                        degree could understand, so I decided to write a paper explaining the algorithm in the simplest yet most complete way possible by
                        prioritizing its beginner-oriented delivery and language.

                    Bogotá's air quality is lousy. To raise awareness about this issue at my school, I partnered with two of my friends to build a web application
                    that retrieves hourly air quality data from the World Air Quality Index Project's website and stores it in a free-access database. We aimed to use
                    this database to create a historical record of Bogotá's and our school's air quality.

                    Richard Feynman said that the best way to learn something is to teach it. I agree with him! A couple of years ago, I was incredibly bad at math,
                    but I discovered that I was just being intellectually lazy and that I could become very proficient at math if I tried to teach it to others.
                    Today, I run a small YouTube channel that I'm very proud of and that allows me to reinforce and organize my thoughts about many mathematical
                    concepts in calculus, algebra, and more!
